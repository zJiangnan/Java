Once there was a Queen. She was sitting at the window. There was snow outside in the garden-snow on the hill and in the lane1, snow on the hunts and on the trees: all things were white with snow.
The Queen was making a coat for a little child. She said, "I want my child to be white as this cloth, white as the snow. And I shall call her Snow-white."
Some days after that the Queen had a child. The child was white as snow. The Queen called her Snow-white.
But the Queen was very ill, and after some days she died. Snow-white lived, and was a very happy and beautiful child.
